Technical Overview:

This application has been constructed utilizing Node.js for backend development. Node.js facilitates efficient handling of concurrency and enables real-time communication capabilities. To manage real-time communication, Socket.IO, an open-source library, has been integrated. Socket.IO enhances the application with robust real-time communication functionalities.

Assumptions and Design Choices:

1. Node.js for Backend Development: The choice of Node.js for backend development was made due to its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations, which are well-suited for handling concurrent connections in real-time applications like chat systems. Additionally, Node.js offers a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries, making it convenient for rapid development.

2. Socket.IO for Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO was selected to facilitate real-time communication within the chat application. Its WebSocket-based communication protocol ensures low-latency, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. This choice enables seamless and instantaneous message exchange, essential for an interactive chat interface.
